# Polling App Test Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the testing strategy and results for the Polling App project. The tests cover both unit and integration testing for all server actions in the application.

## Test Coverage

The following server actions have been tested:

1. **Authentication Actions**
   - `getCurrentUser` - Tests for successful session retrieval, no session, and error handling

2. **Environment Checks**
   - `checkEnvironment` - Tests for various environment variable configurations

3. **Database Tests**
   - `testDatabase` - Tests for database connectivity and table accessibility

4. **Poll Management**
   - `createPoll` - Tests for poll creation with options
   - `getPolls` - Tests for retrieving all polls
   - `getPollById` - Tests for retrieving a specific poll with its options and votes
   - `updatePoll` - Tests for updating poll details and options
   - `deletePoll` - Tests for deleting polls

5. **Voting**
   - `submitVote` - Tests for vote submission, duplicate vote prevention, and error handling

6. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete poll lifecycle from creation to deletion, including voting

## Test Results

All tests are passing successfully. The test suite includes:

- 8 test suites
- 36 individual tests
- 0 snapshots

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual server actions in isolation with mocked dependencies. Key aspects of the unit testing approach:

1. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - Supabase client is mocked to simulate database operations
   - `next/cache` is mocked to simulate path revalidation
   - `next/navigation` is mocked for routing functions
   - Console errors are mocked to prevent test output pollution

2. **Test Cases**:
   - Happy path scenarios (successful operations)
   - Error handling scenarios (database errors, validation errors)
   - Edge cases (unauthenticated users, duplicate votes)

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between different server actions. The main integration test covers:

1. Creating a poll with options
2. Retrieving polls list
3. Getting a specific poll by ID
4. Updating the poll
5. Submitting a vote
6. Deleting the poll

This ensures that the complete user flow works as expected.

## Test Files

1. `lib/actions/__tests__/auth.test.ts`
2. `lib/actions/__tests__/check-env.test.ts`
3. `lib/actions/__tests__/create-poll.test.ts`
4. `lib/actions/__tests__/get-polls.test.ts`
5. `lib/actions/__tests__/poll-actions.test.ts`
6. `lib/actions/__tests__/test-db.test.ts`
7. `lib/actions/__tests__/vote-actions.test.ts`
8. `lib/actions/__tests__/integration.test.ts`

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Console Error Handling**:
   - Challenge: Console errors in tests were polluting the test output
   - Solution: Implemented global console error mocking in beforeEach/afterEach hooks

2. **Mock Structure Alignment**:
   - Challenge: Mock return structures needed to match actual implementation
   - Solution: Updated mock objects to match the exact structure of real responses

3. **Integration Test Coordination**:
   - Challenge: Ensuring consistent state across multiple action calls
   - Solution: Created a comprehensive mock that handles different table queries appropriately

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Error Handling**: Some server actions could benefit from more robust error handling and validation
2. **Add More Edge Cases**: Consider adding tests for more edge cases, especially around concurrent operations
3. **Performance Testing**: Add tests to verify performance under load, especially for database operations
4. **E2E Testing**: Complement the current test suite with end-to-end tests using tools like Cypress or Playwright

## Conclusion

The test suite provides good coverage of the server actions in the Polling App. All tests are passing, indicating that the core functionality is working as expected. The combination of unit and integration tests ensures that both individual components and their interactions are verified.
